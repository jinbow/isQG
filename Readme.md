interior+surface Quasi-Geostrophic (isQG)
=============================================

The latest documentation can be found here: https://isqg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

This software applies QG framework to retrieve ocean interior state using Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Sea Surface Height (SSH) anomaly fields and ocean stratification as the input. It has assumption that the considered ocean physics follow QG dynamics, which is a fair assumption for spatial scales larger than $\mathcal{O}(10km)$.
