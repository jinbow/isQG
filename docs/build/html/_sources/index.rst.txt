Welcome to isQG's documentation!
================================

The interior+surface Quasi-geostrophic (isQG) framework aims to reconstruct the three dimensional subsurface state in the ocean based on the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Sea Surface Height (SSH) fields together with climatology of the local ocean stratification. It was initially proposed by `Wang et al. 2013 <https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/43/8/jpo-d-12-0204.1.xml>`_ and has been evolving since. Here is the information for installing, using the software, and the way to contribute.

This document is under development.
