Welcome to isQG's documentation!
================================

isQG is a framework proposed by `Wang et al. 2013 <https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/43/8/jpo-d-12-0204.1.xml>`_ in which three dimentional subsurface state in the ocean is reconstructed using information of Sea Surface Temperature, Sea Surface Height and a horizontally averaged stratification profile. This brief tutorial will show you how to use the python package. Please email me if you are interested in trying it.
